# Covid BI Dashboard

Feel free to explore and interact with this COVID-19 Business Intelligence visualization dashboard. The application allows users to view historical data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across multiple countries and their respective provinces. 

This project uses the free public API provided by [https://disease.sh/](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/), and the web application is built using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and visualization libraries (such as Highcharts) to display time series data, cross-country comparisons, and interactive data exploration. 

## Features

- A dropdown menu where the user can select a country.
- A dropdown menu where the user can select provinces based on the country the user has selected.
- The Highchart graphs will change dynamically depending on the user's selection of country and province.
